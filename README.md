# 100days
100 days of AI/ML. Study or apply AI/ML for at least 1 hour each of the next 100 days, starting at July 23.

# Day 1 [2019-07-23]
Work on a Random Forest model to predict urban fire incidents in Hermosillo, MÃ©xico using <a href="http://datamx.io/dataset/servicios-bomberos-hermosillo">Servicio de Bomberos de Hermosillo</a> open database

# Day 2 [2019-07-24]
Worked on Random Forest model for Saturdays.ai for prediction of fire incidents in Hermosillo. Played with MLaaS software <a href="https://www.intersectlabs.io/">Intersect Labs</a>, the software is very limited since it will not allow you to do any data preprocessing and will not let you work with categorical data before their algorithm starts. I am building a MLaaS myself for lead scoring.

# Day 3 [2019-07-25]
Worked on cleaning a dataset for one of our customers that will be used for predicting churn rate. I also made updates to this week's python code for Saturdays.ai Hermosillo class. 

# Day 4[2019-07-26]
Worked on Random Forest prediction model for Saturdays.AI class. Prepared material for Intro to Random Forests - Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting Kaggle Challenge that will be share with the class. We are expecting to have a blog post for the Fire Prediction after the groups' presentations.
